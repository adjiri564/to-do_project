# To-Do Application

This repository contains files for a Task Manager application built with JavaScript. The application allows users to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the To-Do application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the To-Do application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the Task and TaskManager classes, as well as functionality to add, delete, and render tasks.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the To-Do application.
2. Use the input fields to add a new task with a title, description, due date, and priority.
3. Click the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list.
4. Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them, and deleted by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
5. Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the Task Manager application. No additional setup is required.
